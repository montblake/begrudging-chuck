            <p className="text-neutral-900 text-md lg:text-lg">In 1853, ten years after having dashed off his surprisingly successful holiday story, <span className="italic">A Christmas Carol</span>, Charles Dickens gave his first public reading of the work. The effort was so well received, as well as providing much needed cash, that Dickens continued to perform these celebrated readings for the rest of his life. In fact, it is believed that his death in 1870 was a direct result of these performances.</p>

          <h2 className="text-neutral-300 text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Premise</h2>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 lg:gap-6">
            <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">In creating this show, Blake Montgomery conflates the enduring popularity of the ubiquitous Christmas Carol with Dickens&apos; readings and imagines the reports of the author&apos;s death were exaggerated. And so, year after year, each and every December, not only do theaters around the globe produce adaptations of his famous book but Dickens himself is brought back to the stage to continue his tradition of solo readings ad infinitum. Whether this miracle is the result of the magic of Christmas, the power of the author&apos;s popularity, or a freak accident resulting from the interaction between an over-eager booking agent and some hitherto unappreciated arcana of contract law, it is impossible to state for certain.</p>
            <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">After 171 years of consecutive readings, Dickens has reached a breaking point. Unbeknownst to the theater management, he will not be performing his show this evening. Tonight will be something entirely different. Something new. Something he is calling, in his head, &ldquo;Charles Dicken&apos;s First Annual Holiday Party.&rdquo; Perhaps Dickens wil get his wish. Or, perhaps, the Spirits of Christmas might intervene and force him to perform his worn-out tale once again. Perhaps, in the course of this performance, following some highly irregular and ridiculous occurrence, he might be forced to re-examine his creation; rediscover its beauty, and re-ignite his passion; al the while, along the way, forging the kind of intimate, joyful connection with the audience that he had hoped would come from hosting a party.</p>

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
            <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">Blake Montgomery&apos;s career in the theater spans both the psychological- and text-based tradition as well as the physical, devised world of movement, mime, and clown theater. Having spent his early career as a director of ensemble clown theater, developed working relationships with non-naturalistic Chicago theater most notably Redmoon, he founded the Building Stage where he served as Artistic Director until its closing in 2013. The company specialized in ensemble-devised, director-driven works, most successfully  working with literary adaptations like their Jeff Award-winning Moby-Dick and poetic, clown-inspired Dawn, Quixote. Blake&apos;s work reflects his training at the Ecole Jacques Lecoq, the Dell&apos;Arte School of Physical Theater, and Middlebury College; he is a member of Actors&apos; Equity.</p>
            <p className="text-md lg:text-lg"><span className="font-bold">Charles Dickens Begrudginglyâ€¦</span> is a both the most terrifying and satisfying project Blake has created. It exemplifies his belief in a play being the interplay between structure and the performers sense of play. It combines his interest in theatrical clowning, love of unique literary narrative voices, traditional acting, and hospitality to create a uniquely personal, warm evening that both skewers and celebrates the famed author, our attachment to traditions, and the spirit of Christmas itself.</p>
