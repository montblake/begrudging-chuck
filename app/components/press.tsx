          The sleeper Christmas event of the season. You don&lsquo;t have to be into Dickens to appreciate it. It is so well done. I want to see it again.
          A great twist on a classic.

          Top-notch performance! Just what we needed to lift our spirits and put the holiday season in perspective.
          What a fun evening! We laughed a lot and got quiet and reflective and also teary-eyed. Very well done and very well performed. Great performance, really. Go.
          An exceptional one-man performance that entertained thoroughly! Superbly crafted and performed.

          With a mixture of humor and fabulous storytelling, this is a must see holiday show. Appropriate for the whole family.
          Absolutely delightful. [...] The performance was original and interactive. [...] The acting was terrific and though it was an unusual adaptation of the story, it really got to the heart of a classic. Highly recommended. I&lsquo;d like to return with my teenage son!
