          The sleeper Christmas event of the season. You don&lsquo;t have to be into Dickens to appreciate it. It is so well done. I want to see it again.

          What a fun evening! We laughed a lot and got quiet and reflective and also teary-eyed. Very well done and very well performed. Great performance, really. Go.

          Absolutely delightful. [...] The performance was original and interactive. [...] The acting was terrific and though it was an unusual adaptation of the story, it really got to the heart of a classic. Highly recommended. I&lsquo;d like to return with my teenage son!
